About PwC Experience:

We aim to build innovative technology solutions that differentiate us from our competitors and digitize the business. 
Part of that included a strategic decision to invest in upskilling programs 
so our people could learn how to use digital tools for data visualization and automation, data cleansing, and more.

If our people could use these tools to solve common problems,
they’d help us become more efficient and growth-oriented now and more innovative later in Business Services and beyond. Now, employees are learning to build bots – over 2,400 have been created so far – to automate workflows. We continue to invest in making processes more intuitive using machine learning, PowerBi, and eventually artificial intelligence (AI). These are key to working faster and solving problems differently for ourselves and our clients.
